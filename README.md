# TEAMS BOT WOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Finally got around to a little bit of optimization (and figured out how to hide my bot's token) so I'm uploading my code to GitHub! <br><br>This is my second bot ***ever***, so expect to find more spaghetti than an Olive Garden and more bugs than... well... an Olive Garden.

# To run:
* Create a ".env" file containing your token for the bot (in the format `TOKEN = 'insert-token-here'` ), copy the path of that file, and paste it into the "dotenv_path" variable. 
* Create a "teams.db" file.
The bot should then run properly on whatever token you put into it.
